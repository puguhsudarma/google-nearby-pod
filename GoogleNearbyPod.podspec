    A CocoaPods package that provides Google's Nearby Connections functionality
    for iOS development. Includes all necessary dependencies and Swift API.
    Dependencies are downloaded automatically during pod install (like node_modules).
    Fully compatible with Expo projects - use targeted :modular_headers => true instead of global use_modular_headers!
